## Exercise 1
A bus company has special rules for price calculation, when hiring a bus incl. chauffeur for a one-day trip. The total price consists of an initial fee plus a kilometer fee. These fees are given below:
There is an initial fee of 2500 kr.

The price depends on the distance as follows:
* Anything below 100 km. costs 10 kr. per km.
* For kilometers between 100 and 500 km the price is 8 kr. per km.
* For kilometers above 500, each kilometer costs 6 kr. per km.

Implement the price calculation function and a unit test that includes all the test cases that you find relevant. It is recommended that you follow a TDD approach.
